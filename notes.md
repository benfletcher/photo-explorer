1. get top 4 interestingness photos
-- no search bar

2. tile them on page

3. under each anchor photos:
-- "camera icon" : takes you to more photos from the photographer
-- 3-5 thumbnail images based on the tags on anchor photo
clicking on any of the items below anchor photo replaces anchor photo with the clicked thumbnail

(?? what does it mean for photographer?)
-- totally new page with only their images
-- only replace the current image with one of the photog's images
---- cycles through the photog's top images
---- each click replaces anchor photo with another from the photog

thumbnails:
mouseover: 'see more *beach* photos...'
mouseover 'camera' : "see more from this photog"
mouseover big


recursive process, never ending

questions:
-- able to go 'back'
-- link to pic on flickr site


app build steps:
1. display big photos
2. add camera icon for photog (clickable)
3. add thumbnails based on anchor photo 'tags' (clickable)

clicking 2 replaces anchor with top photo from photog
clicking 3 replaces anchor with the thumbnail image
each of these generates new thumbnails under new anchor just like first time



Way down the road:
-- referral generation $$ ?
